# ACS_Website
This repo is meant to hold current and past versions of the Student Members of the American Chemical Society Website!

I've never used Git, Github, HTML, or CSS before, so to say this will be a work in progress is to say the least.

Currently this site is not attached to any domain name, so it can only run locally.


### NOTE: This repo is now archived, as ownership was transfered to a neutral acsumich account to preserve functionality after I graduate.

## TO DO:

* ~~Format Workshops page to include pagination holding all available workshops, details, and slides~~
* ~~Formate Events page to include calendar with all currently scheduled events, possibly hooked up to google calendar?~~
* ~~Design Home page to include relevant information, links, etc~~
* ~~Add social media links other than this repo~~
* ~~Add link to email list~~ or GroupMe somewhere
* Add member bios to about page
* ~~Add mission statement~~
* Add upcoming event flyers
